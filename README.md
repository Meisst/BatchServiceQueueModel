<h2> DES model of batch service queue system </br>(fixed group size M/M^Y/1) </h2>

<h2>The validity of the simulation results was verified by an analytical solution </h2>

Module for analytical solution was built on the basis of book: "Medhi, J. Stochastic Models in Queueing Theory"

NOTE: You can optimize the results of calculations of simulation characteristics by calculating them at the time of completion of maintenance of demand group, and not after a complete simulation
